### VENARIA
At the gates of the city of Turin, at the foot of the Alps is the seventeenth-century palace of Venaria Reale, one of the most elegant residences of the Savoy kingdoms. From a detail of his magniloquent marble flooring we have drawn inspiration to develop this lining which has for this reason the typical Opus Scutulatum pattern of Roman origin.

### SAN MATTEO
In a sunny town on the famous Amalfi Coast, founded by the Etruscans in the 6th century BC, stands the Cathedral of Salerno. Built between 1080 and 1085 AD. It houses two magnificent ambones donated by the Archbishops of the city, Romualdo Guarna and Niccolò d’Aiello. Aiello’s decorative mosaics were the starting point for developing a motif of Byzantine taste.

### CASINO VERNIER
Between the Rialto Bridge and St. Marco square in Venice, near the Bareteri Bridge, there is the Casino Venier, a venue once dedicated to parties and gambling, but also a literary lounge. Inside, there are valuable marble floors dating back to the 18th century. From these stunning geometric patterns, we developed our motivs.

### SAN MARCO
From his first consecration in 832 AD To the present day, the Basilica of San Marco remains one of the symbols of the city of Venice. Among the dozens of marble floors inside, we were inspired by the figure of the starred dodecahedron attributed to Paolo Uccello, a Florentine painter who lived in Venice between 1425 and 1430 AD.
