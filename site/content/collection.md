# Hidden Heritage

By admiring Vesuvius’ towering profile through the columns of a Roman domus in ancient Pompeii; passing the thresholds of St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome; walking through the corridors by the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, surrounded by statues and paintings ; crossing the Canal Grande on a gondola boat in Venice, or strolling along the naves of the Duomo in Milan, we are reminded that the essence of beauty is hidden in the fundamental details, like the very land beneath our feet.

The capsule collection “Hidden heritage” was born for people who express their unconscious tastes and desires through accessories and niceties that define their eclectic style and the urge to be different, maintaining the formal nature of the status quo.

This is all in pursuit of a simple goal, to give shape to a high-quality, crafted artifact, that is unique and handmade by Italian artisans, using techniques that transform expertise into art, thus creating a classic, timeless, and functional object.

# INSIDE

Inside, the backpack is lined with motivs inspired by the cultural heritage forever embedded in the pavements of Italian churches, palaces and squares; patterns that have always been there to amaze eyes and souls of the sharp observants throughout the centuries.

### VENARIA

At the gates of the city of Turin, at the foot of the Alps is the seventeenth-century palace of Venaria Reale, one of the most elegant residences of the Savoy kingdoms. From a detail of his magniloquent marble flooring we have drawn inspiration to develop this lining which has for this reason the typical Opus Scutulatum pattern of Roman origin.

### SAN MATTEO

In a sunny town on the famous Amalfi Coast, founded by the Etruscans in the 6th century BC, stands the Cathedral of Salerno. Built between 1080 and 1085 AD. It houses two magnificent ambones donated by the Archbishops of the city, Romualdo Guarna and Niccolò d’Aiello. Aiello’s decorative mosaics were the starting point for developing a motif of Byzantine taste.

### CASINO VERNIER

Between the Rialto Bridge and St. Marco square in Venice, near the Bareteri Bridge, there is the Casino Venier, a venue once dedicated to parties and gambling, but also a literary lounge. Inside, there are valuable marble floors dating back to the 18th century. From these stunning geometric patterns, we developed our motivs.

### SAN MARCO

From his first consecration in 832 AD To the present day, the Basilica of San Marco remains one of the symbols of the city of Venice. Among the dozens of marble floors inside, we were inspired by the figure of the starred dodecahedron attributed to Paolo Uccello, a Florentine painter who lived in Venice between 1425 and 1430 AD.
